# Face-Aging-App
# AI-Powered Face Aging App

## 📌 Overview
The **AI-Powered Face Aging App** is a deep learning-based application that predicts and simulates aging effects on human faces. Using advanced AI models, the app processes an input image and generates an aged or de-aged version of the face.

## 🚀 Features
- Predicts how a person’s face will change over time.
- Supports multiple age progression and regression stages.
- Uses deep learning models for accurate aging effects.
- Simple interface for easy image uploads and processing.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- Python
- OpenCV
- TensorFlow/Keras (or PyTorch)
- Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)
- NumPy, Matplotlib

## 🏗️ Installation
1. Clone the repository:
